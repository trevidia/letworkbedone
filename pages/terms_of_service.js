                            <b>Letworkbedone</b> uses the feedback reviews provided by clients to rate our freelancer’s
                            performance. Once a job is delivered, a client has three days to respond and to post a
                            review. If no response is provided within that period, the job request will be considered
                            completed and delivered.
